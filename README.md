## The Planetary Data Reader (pdr)

This tool provides a single command---`read(‘/path/to/file’)`---for ingesting
_all_ common planetary data types. It is currently in development. Almost every kind
of "primary observational data" product currently archived in the PDS
(under PDS3 or PDS4) should be covered eventually. [Currently-supported datasets are listed here.](supported_datasets.md) 

If the software fails while attempting to read from datasets that we have listed as supported, please submit an issue with a link to the file and information about the error (if applicable). There might also be datasets that work but are not listed. We would like to hear about those too. If a dataset is not yet supported that you would like us to consider prioritizing, [please fill out this request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JHyMDzC9LlXY4MOMcHqV5fbseSB096_PsLshAMqMWBw/viewform).

### Installation
_pdr_ is not yet on `pip` or `conda`. We recommend cloning the repository and 
installing it into a `conda`environment made from the provided `environment.yml` file, like:
```
git clone https://github.com/MillionConcepts/pdr.git
cd pdr
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pdr 
pip install -e .
```
The minimum supported version of Python is _3.9_.

Using environment.yml during installation will install all dependencies
(both required and optional) for pdr. If you'd prefer to forego the optional
dependencies please use minimal_environment.yml. Optional dependencies and their
added functions are listed below:

  - pvl: allows Data.load("LABEL", as_pvl=True) which will load your label as a pvl object instead of plain text
  - astropy: allows reading of .fits files
  - jupyter: allows usage of the Example Jupyter Notebook (and other jupyter notebooks you create)
  - pillow: allows reading of TIFF files and rendering browse images
  - matplotlib: allows usage of `save_sparklines`, an experimental browse function

### Usage

(You can check out our example Notebook on Binder for a 
quick interactive demo of functionality: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/millionconcepts/pdr/master))

Just run `import pdr` and then `pdr.read(filename)` where _filename_ is the
full path to a data file _or_ a metadata / label file (extensions .LBL,
.lbl, or .xml). `read()` will look for corresponding data or metadata
files in the same path, or read metadata directly from the data file if it has
an attached label.

The function will return a `pdr.Data` object whose attributes include all of the data
and metadata. These attributes are named according to the names of the data
objects as given in the label. They can be accessed either as attributes or using
`dict`-style \[\] index notation. For example, PDS3 image objects are often
named "IMAGE", so you could examine a PDS3 image as an array with:
```
>>> data = pdr.read("/path/to/cr0_398560467edr_f0030004ccam02012m1.LBL")
>>> data['IMAGE']
array([[21, 21, 20, ..., 19, 19, 20],
       [21, 21, 21, ..., 19, 20, 20],
       [21, 21, 20, ..., 20, 20, 20],
       ...,
       [25, 25, 25, ..., 26, 26, 26],
       [25, 25, 25, ..., 27, 26, 26],
       [24, 25, 25, ..., 26, 26, 26]], dtype=int16)
```
The primary metadata is stored within the `pdr.Data` object as a `pdr.Metadata` object. The values within the 
metadata can be accessed using `dict`-style \[\] index notation. For example:
```
>>> data.metadata['INSTRUMENT_HOST_NAME']
'MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY'
```
Some PDS products (like this one) contain multiple data objects. You can look
at all of the objects associated with a product with `.keys()`:
```
>>> data.keys()
['LABEL',
 'IMAGE_HEADER',
 'ANCILLARY_TABLE',
 'CMD_REPLY_FRAME_SOHB_TABLE',
 'SOH_BEFORE_CHECKSUM_TABLE',
 'TAKE_IMAGE_TIME_TABLE',
 'CMD_REPLY_FRAME_SOHA_TABLE',
 'SOH_AFTER_CHECKSUM_TABLE',
 'MUHEADER_TABLE',
 'MUFOOTER_TABLE',
 'IMAGE_REPLY_TABLE',
 'IMAGE',
 'MODEL_DESC']
 ```

### Output data types
In general:
+ Image data are presented as `numpy` arrays.
+ Table data are presented as `pandas` DataFrames.
+ Header and label data are presented as plain text objects.
+ Metadata is read from the label and presented as a pdr.Metadata class (behaves as a `dict`)
+ Other data are presented as simple python types (`str`, `tuple`, `dict`).
+ Data loaded from PDS4 .xml labels [are presented as whatever object
  `pds4-tools` returns.](https://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/tools/pds4_tools_docs/current/) We plan to normalize this behavior in the future.
+ There might be rare exceptions.

### Notes and Caveats
#### Additional processing
Some data, especially calibrated image data, require the application of
additional offsets or scale factors to convert the storage units to meaningful
physical units. The information on how and when to apply such adjustments is
typically stored (as plain text) in the instrument SIS, and the scale factors
themselves are often (but not always) stored in the label. Many calibrated
image files also contain special constants (like missing or invalid data),
which are often not explicitly specified in the label. `pdr` is therefore not
guaranteed to know anything about or correctly apply these constants.

`pdr.Data` objects offer a convenience method that attempts to mask invalid
values and apply any scaling and offset specified in the label. Use it like:
`scaled_image = data.get_scaled('IMAGE')`. However, we do not perform science
validation of these outputs, so **do not trust that they are ready for
analysis** without further processing or validation. Contributions towards making this
more effective for specific data product types are very much welcomed.

If you'd like to visualize the outputs that this creates the `dump_browse`
feature creates a separate browse product (.jpg, .txt., or .csv) in the folder
you execute from. Use it like: `data.dump_browse()`. This uses the get_scaled
feature for images and will also output browse products for tables and labels.

#### PDS4 products
All valid PDS4 products should be fully supported. `pdr.Data` simply wraps
`pds4-tools`. They may not, however, behave in exactly the same way as objects
loaded using *pdr*'s native functionality. In general, if a PDS3 label is
available for a product, we recommend loading the product from it rather than
the PDS4 label. We plan to implement a unified interface for PDS3 and PDS4
metadata later on in the project.

#### .FMT files
Some PDS3 table data are defined in external reference files (usually with a
`.FMT` extension). You can often find these in the LABEL or DOCUMENT
subdirectories of the data archive volumes. If you place the relevant format
files in the same directory as the data files you are trying to read, *pdr*
will be able to find them. Otherwise, it will not and a warning will be thrown 
with the name of the file needed to assist in locating it. Future functionality 
may make this smoother.

#### Data attribute naming
The observational and metadata attributes (or keys) of `pdr.Data`
objects take their names directly from the metadata files. We believe that
maintaining this strong correlation between the representation of the data
in-language and the representation of the data in-file is important, even when
it causes us to break strict PEP-8 standards for attribute capitalization.
There are three exceptions at present:
1. Some table formats include repeated column names. For usability and
compatibility, we force these to be unique by suffixing 0-indexed increasing
integers. So a table definition with two separate columns named "COLUMN" will return a pandas DataFrame with columns named "COLUMN_0" and "COLUMN_1."
2. PDS3 data object names sometimes contain spaces. _pdr_ replaces the spaces
with underscores in order to make them usable as attributes.
3. PDS4 labels loaded by `pds4-tools` are renamed "LABEL" for internal
consistency. We plan to deprecate this behavior in the future.

#### Lazy loading
`pdr.Data.read` has lazy loading as default and will only load data objects from 
a file when that object is referenced. For example, calling data.IMAGE will load 
the IMAGE object at that time. You can alternatively load objects by using the 
`load` method, like `data.load("IMAGE")`. You can also pass the 'all' argument 
to load all data objects, like `data.load('all')`. Lazy-loading variety 
of reasons, but one common use case is accessing products with multiple large 
files (like Chandrayaan-1 M3 L1B and L2 products). It is likely that in many cases 
you will only want to reference one or two of those files, and not waste time and 
memory loading all of them on initialization.

#### Missing files
If a file referenced by a label is missing, *pdr* will throw warnings and
populate the associated attribute from the portion of the label that mentions
that file. You are most likely to encounter this for DESCRIPTION files in
document formats (like .TXT). These warnings do not prevent you from using
objects loaded from files that are actually present in your filesystem.

#### Big files (like HiRISE)
`pdr` currently performs no special memory management, so use caution 
when attempting to read very large files. We intend to implement memory
management in the future.

### tests

Our testing methodology for *pdr* currently focuses on end-to-end integration
testing to ensure consistency, coverage of supported datasets, and (to the extent we can verify it) correctness of output.

the test suite for *pdr* lives in a different repository: https://github.com/MillionConcepts/pdr-tests. Its core is an application called
**ix**. It should be considered a fairly complete alpha; we are actively using 
it both as a regression test suite and an active development tool.
