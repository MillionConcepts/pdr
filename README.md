## The Planetary Data Reader (pdr)

This tool provides a single command---`read(‘/path/to/file’)`---for ingesting
_all_ common planetary data types. It is currently in development. Almost every kind
of "primary observational data" product currently archived in the PDS
(under PDS3 or PDS4) should be covered eventually. [Currently-supported datasets are listed here.](docs/supported_datasets.md) 

If the software fails while attempting to read from datasets that we have listed as supported, please submit an issue with a link to the file and information about the error (if applicable). There might also be datasets that work but are not listed. We would like to hear about those too. If a dataset is not yet supported that you would like us to consider prioritizing, [please fill out this request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JHyMDzC9LlXY4MOMcHqV5fbseSB096_PsLshAMqMWBw/viewform).

### Attribution
If you use _pdr_ in your work, please cite us using our Zenodo DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/266449940.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/266449940)

### Installation
_pdr_ is now on `conda` and `pip`. We recommend (and only officially support) installation into a `conda` environment.
You can do this like so: 

```
conda create --name pdrenv
conda activate pdrenv
conda install -c conda-forge pdr
```
The minimum supported version of Python is _3.9_.

Using the conda install will install all dependencies in the environment.yml 
file (both required and optional) for pdr. If you'd prefer to forego the 
optional dependencies, please use minimal_environment.yml in your 
installation. This is not supported through a direct conda install as 
described above and will reqiore additional steps. Optional dependencies 
and the added functionality they support are listed below:

  - `pvl`: allows `Data.load("LABEL", as_pvl=True)` which will load PDS3 labels as `pvl` objects rather than plain text
  - `astropy`: adds support for FITS files
  - `jupyter`: allows usage of the Example Jupyter Notebook (and other jupyter notebooks you create)
  - `pillow`: adds support for TIFF files and browse image rendering
  - `matplotlib`: allows usage of `save_sparklines`, an experimental browse function

### Usage

(You can check out our example Notebook on Binder for a 
quick interactive demo of functionality:

Additional information on usage including examples, output data types, notes and caveats, test, etc. 
can now be accessed in our documentation on readthedocs at: https://pdr.readthedocs.io [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pdr/badge/?version=latest)](https://pdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
