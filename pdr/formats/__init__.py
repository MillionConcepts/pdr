"""This module contains special case formats for nonconforming or malformatted data
types organized by mission and/or instrument. The `checkers` module consists of functions
that are called by `pdr.func.specialize` to determine if a given file meets the stated criteria.
If a file meets the criteria in the checker, a file from the respective special case formats
module is returned. If not, the base pdr workflow is continued."""
